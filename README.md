This is an ADC dataset that contains three types of ADC data. These three types of ADC are pipeline ADC, TI ADC, and SAR ADC.
1、
The data of pipeline ADC is collected from real ADC, and this ADC chip is ADI's AD9613, with a sampling rate of 250mHz and a resolution of 12 bits.
The frequency range of the collected signal is from 10MHz to 20MHz，and the reference signal used is generated by the Matlab behavior level model.
The signal generator is Rohde&Schwarz SMA100B produced by the company Electrorent Corporation.

2、
The data of SAR ADC is obtained through MATLAB simulation, which includes comparator error and DAC capacitor mismatch error.
The frequency range of the collected signal is from 10MHz to 20MHz.
The error signal used is generated by the model with added errors,and the reference signal used is generated by the Matlab behavior level model.

3、The data of TI ADC is obtained through MATLAB simulation, which includes time mismatch error, gain error, bias error, and thermal noise.
