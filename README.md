# ADC_data
This is an ADC dataset that contains three types of ADC data. These three types of ADC are pipeline ADC, TI ADC, and SAR ADC. 
These data are included in the master branch.

1、The data of pipeline ADC is collected from real ADC, and this ADC chip is ADI's AD9613, with a sampling rate of 250mHz and a resolution of 12 bits.

2、The data of SAR ADC is obtained through MATLAB simulation, which includes comparator error and DAC capacitor mismatch error.

3、The data of TI ADC is obtained through MATLAB simulation, which includes time mismatch error, gain error, bias error, and thermal noise.
